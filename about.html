		<h2 align="center">About the Webpage</h2>
		<p>This webpage contains many different tools and design elements. In this description we will delve into the tools and frameworks that we used in the development in this website. This will allow for users to get a comprehensive understanding of the tool and how they can use this technology to build their own tool.</p>
		<p>To build the map for the website we used the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/">Google Maps API </a>.  This allowed us to get a base for the tool. We decided that we wanted it to have an interactive map component so that it would be easier for users to visualize the air quality around the world. This API also allows us and the user to search for specific locations within the map, this can be done either through a name of a place or coordinates. </p>
		<p>The next tool that we used was the <a href="https://docs.openaq.org">Open AQ Platform API</a>. This API allows us to gather data about the air quality of a certain locations and the surrounding areas. We use this information to update a table that is located on the main page about the air quality. This API and information will also allow us to display the air quality information on top of the Google Map. </p>
		<p>In the project we used a framework called <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular JS </a>. This framework has allowed us to create the air quality table, by looping through all of the data that was gathered from the Open AQ API. The framework prevents us from having to loop through the data ourselves and will select out only the information that we want. </p>
		<p>In the end, the final project will allow users to view a map, search the map, and view the air quality data of specific locations. This is all done through the Google Maps API, Open AQ API, and the use of the framework Angular. We are appreciative that we have access to these tools to build a website like this.</p>
